At the start of this, I was only vaguely familiar with the concept of a binary search due to previous exploration into sorting algorithms for fun. This helped me understand what was going on with the binary search algorithm as I read about it, and helped me break down what their more raw code is doing. I took time to parse through the steps of what it is expected to do and translated that into how I would write the algorithm in JavaScript.
